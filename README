README

This is a very simple Scheme like Lisp interpreter written in Gauche. There is
no tail call optimization, no first class continuation, no ‘define-syntax.’

eval.scm
    eval and apply.
base-env.scm
    Basic environment to pass to eval.
t/*
    Tests. Run, for example, by ‘gosh t/9all.scm’

All names defined in eval.scm and base-env.scm are prefixed with ‘*,’ so use
‘*eval’ instead of ‘eval’, for example.
